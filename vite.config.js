// `frontend/` stays the Vite root so the Vercel project's Root Directory and
// frontend/vercel.json keep working untouched. Output goes to dist/, which is
// what both Vercel and backend/server.js now serve.
//
// Social metadata needs an ABSOLUTE origin: scrapers do not resolve
// root-relative og:image reliably. Vite's own %VAR% substitution leaves the
// literal token in place when the variable is unset, which would ship
// `href="%VITE_SITE_ORIGIN%/"` to production, so the plugin below does the
// substitution itself.
//
// Resolving the public origin, in order of how much we trust it:
//
//   1. VITE_SITE_ORIGIN              - set by hand; the only one that can
//                                      know about a custom domain.
//   2. VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL - Vercel's own production hostname,
//                                      exposed to every build. Stable
//                                      across deploys, so it is safe to
//                                      put in a canonical.
//   3. VERCEL_URL                    - this deployment's unique hostname.
//                                      Different on every push, so it is
//                                      only reached on previews, where a
//                                      canonical pointing at the preview
//                                      is what you want anyway.
//
// Falling all the way through used to be the normal case, and it shipped
// href="/" in canonical and og:url - which no scraper resolves, so every
// share card rendered imageless. On Vercel that can no longer happen.
