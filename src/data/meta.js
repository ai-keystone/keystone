   Per-route metadata.

   Before Phase 5 all eight routes served one identical <head>: one title,
   one description, no <link rel="canonical"> anywhere, and og:url /
   og:image pointing at a Cloud Run host that is not even the current one
   (vercel.json rewrites to keystone-api-yhicwzbyja). The referenced
   images/og-preview.png did not exist, so every share card on X, LinkedIn,
   Slack and iMessage rendered imageless.

   SITE_ORIGIN: set VITE_SITE_ORIGIN at build time to the public origin.
   Without it we fall back to the runtime origin, which is always correct
   for canonical but is not visible to scrapers that do not run JS - so
   the build-time value is what makes share cards resolve.
